Hone your skills.
Level them with your body.
Breathe me some life.
Give me some lips to kiss so sweet.

I gotta fall inlove, just a little, for you to make a play.

Give me something to hold onto.
Give me something to hug.  
Make me need you, at least for today.

We can be safe.
We can make the fire small.
But if you let it smolder too long it goes out.

If you put nothing forth, you get nothing back.

Give me your lips.  Let me suck them dry.
Give me hunger pangs of love.

Let me suckle on your fruit and drink deep from your cup.
I want you.
I want you.
I want you.

Breathe and heave those hips.  Humming with your moans.
I want to vibrate your throat muscles with my hands.
I want to etch my name into your thighs with my lips.
I want you to get hungry, with a carnal lust.

I want you, dipped, wet and ready.

I hunger.  I hunger for your eyes.  And the feeling of release.
Release onto me.  Because it's been time to say.  Fuck me, love me, hate me, leave me.
But do it to me.  Do it with me.  Deep and low.  Soft and full of purpose.

I want a lay.  I want to have a hayday.  But I can't if you just close your mind.  If you just close your thighs.
Give me something to have.  Give me you.  So I can give you me.
