I feel sluggish from the night before.  My eyes are heavy and tired.  In the small of my back, just to the right of my spine there is some dull pain.
It comes and goes as I nosh on my jaw.  My teeth are disintgrating a little more everyday, I need to brush my teeth more, but I don't.  I just watch
and let them dissolve.  Using them while I have them.  I see myself becoming my father, a little more everyday.  When I was young I swore I would never
be him.  But now, I see it happening.  It's not that I don't love my father.  Far from that.  I simply see him intombed in his body these days.  He is old.
He is in bad physical shape.  Everything is intellectual for him.  His mind is all he has.  And it is a strong mind.  But still, his physical struggles,
they are sad.  I know this is the process, but still.  I believe he could avoid some of his issues: type 2 diabetes, lathergy.  

I can feel the strength leaving my body, as I am no longer a young man.  I can feel myself pulling into old age and depression.  I thought having a wife would
make me this way.  I just assumed it was being married that made him old.  That I would be able to stay fit as long as long as I was single.  But now,
I think being married may have kept him in better shape.  Now I believe that the cause of his physical condition is genetic and I am doomed for the same
fate.  But I try to fight it.  I try very hard to fight it.  

Why do I discuss this, when I could be exercising?  Because I am training my mind, at present.  I am working towards a mind that is strong.  I am working
towards my own strength.
