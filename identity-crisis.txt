So am I an economist or a computer scientist?  My training is certainly still mostly as an economist, but all my work experience is as a developer.  These
seem to be the skills I must make use of.  Sure I have been working as a economist for the past few months, and it's been great.  But still, will I get to
keep doing it?  I certainly hope so.  Once my tenor at the federal reserve is over, I'll need to find work as an economist.  I wonder if anyone will ever
find this blog that works there.  Well, it doesn't matter, as long as they don't know my name they won't be able to know that I will be leaving in a year
and a half.  Those are the terms of my service and so those are the terms I will follow.  It's strange to think I'll be 30 when it's done.  But then, I'll
get the rest of my life for whatever I want.
